    create function that prevents user from getting trapped and unable to move if the spaces around it are already explored; make them
    be able to escape that trap and go to the nearest '0' that also does not have explored spaces all around it so it is able to keep moving
    (already kinda made (check method "stuck()"), need to clean it up a little); check new error png for error
    make user leave the island immediately after all positions have been explored
        as in the words of the genius vivian: 
            "but yea check for end-of-game conditions by checking if the board is full as well as if youre stuck
            then if thats true then end the game"
    code formatting is very off and some of the logic is v shitty
    while(true) is not a valid condition- FIX!

/* Checklist: 

    ● Ask the user the number of treasures, and pirates to place on the board. ✓
        ○ No more than 10 each. ✓
        ○ The number of treasures cannot be more than the number of pirates. ✓
        ○ Randomly generate their positions ✓
    ● There will be ONE escape on the board. When the user sees a ship, they can either leave the
        island, or stay. ✓
        ○ If they stay on the island, the current spot is marked as explored and a new escape is generated on the board in a spot 
            that has not been explored. ✓
        ○ If they have explored all possible positions on the island, they HAVE to leave the island. X
    ● Use a 2D array or an array of arrays! ✓

    ● Begin game with a menu: ✓
        1. Play game
        2. How to play
        3. Legend
        4. Exit
    ● Provide a legend for the user at any time during game play. ✓ (sort of? provide when user prompts, or provide all the time on each turn?)
    ● Make sure that the user’s position entry is between 0 and 99, inclusive. ✓ (sort of? only lets user go W, A, S, or D; error handling correctly?)
    ● Display the current board after each round. ✓
    ● Unexplored spots are marked with a 0. ✓
    ● Mark explored spots with a #. ✓
    ● Display a total treasure during each round. ✓ (should I re-format this?)
    ● Contain a printBoard method that will print the updated board every time the user takes a
      turn. ✓
    ● Have an isVacant method that will return true if the position is unexplored and false
     otherwise ✓
