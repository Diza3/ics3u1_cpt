TREASURE HUNT
You may work with a partner, this part of your CPT is worth 20% of your final mark.
Introduction
For this game, the user will be going on a treasure hunt. They will explore a 10 x 10 board that will
contain treasure, pirates and an escape off the island. The goal is to escape the island with the most
treasure possible.

Treasure(T) - increases as more treasure is found (ie, the first treasure is +100 gold doubloons, the
second is +200 gold doubloons and so on)
Pirates (P) - the more pirates you encounter the more gold doubloons they can take. (ie. the first
crew is -100 gold doubloons, the second crew is -200 gold doubloons and so on) BUT, if the player
has no treasure, there is nothing to be lost.
Both (B)- If there is treasure AND pirates, the player gets half the treasure available.
Escape (X) - When a ship is seen in the distance, the user can leave the island.

Level 3 (up to 80)
● A predefined 10 x 10 board, with 5 pirates, 5 treasures and 3 escapes loaded using Strings or
arrays (try and use Bs as well)
● If the user sees all three ships, they have to leave.
Level 4 (up to 90)
● Use Strings or arrays to set up a 10 x 10 game board
● Have the computer randomly generate positions of 5 treasures, 5 pirates and 3 escape
● If the user sees all three ships, they have to leave.

Level +
● Ask the user the number of treasures, and pirates to place on the board.
  ○  No more than 10 each.
  ○ The number of treasures cannot be more than the number of pirates.
  ○ Randomly generate their positions
● There will be ONE escape on the board. When the user sees a ship, they can either leave the
island, or stay.
  ○ If they stay on the island, the current spot is marked as explored and a new escape is
  generated on the board in a spot that has not been explored.
  ○ If they have explored all possible positions on the island, they HAVE to leave
  the island.
● Use a 2D array or an array of arrays!


ALL must …
● Begin game with a menu:
  1. Play game
  2. How to play
  3. Legend
  4. Exit
● Provide a legend for the user at any time during game play.
● Make sure that the user’s position entry is between 0 and 99, inclusive.
● Display the current board after each round.
● Unexplored spots are marked with a 0.
● Mark explored spots with a #.
● Have a counter to count the number of pirates, treasure and ships (level 2 & 3 NOT level 4) .
● Display a total treasure during each round.
● Contain a printBoard method that will print the updated board every time the user takes a
turn.
● Have an isVacant method that will return true if the position is unexplored and false
otherwise

Legend:
0 - indicates that spot has not been explored yet
T - indicates treasure, 100 gold doubloon
P - indicates pirates, lose 100 gold doubloon
B - indicates both treasure and pirates, 50 gold doubloon
X - escape the island

Predefined Board 1D Array (if needed)
char gameBoard [] = {0, T, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0, 0, T, 0, 0, 0,

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, B, 0, 0, X}

Predefined Board 2D Array (if needed)
char gameBoard [][] = {{0, T, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},{0, 0, T, 0, 0,
0, B, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, P, 0, 0}, {P, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

{0, 0, 0, X, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, B, 0, 0, X}}

My printBoard method
public static void printBoard(char[][] pBoard) {
int row = 10;
System.out.println("\nPLAYER BOARD \n");
for (int i = 0; i < pBoard.length; i++) {
if (i == 0) {
System.out.print("Position [00 - 09]\t");
} else {
System.out.print("Position [" + row + " - " + (row + 9) +
"]\t");
row += 10;
}
for (int j = 0; j < pBoard[i].length; j++) {
System.out.print(pBoard[i][j] + " ");
}
System.out.println("");
}
}


Note:
You may need two boards, one for the game board and one for the player board.
